# canopy-eslint
A standard [eslint](https://eslint.org/) config for Canopy frontend developers. This assumes that you're using babel and babel-eslint [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint).

## Usage
Create an `.eslintrc` file in your project's root directory:

```
{
  "extends": "canopy"
}
```
After installing `eslint` and `babel-eslint`, you can test if it works by doing `npx eslint`
